Analyze this Qwen Code session and extract structured facets.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:

1. **goal_categories**: Count ONLY what the USER explicitly asked for.
   - DO NOT count Qwen's autonomous codebase exploration
   - DO NOT count work Qwen decided to do on its own
   - ONLY count when user says "can you...", "please...", "I need...", "let's...
   - POSSIBLE CATEGORIES (but be open to others that appear in the data):
      - bug_fix
      - feature_request
      - debugging
      - test_creation
      - code_refactoring
      - documentation_update
   "

2. **user_satisfaction_counts**: Base ONLY on explicit user signals.
   - "Yay!", "great!", "perfect!" → happy
   - "thanks", "looks good", "that works" → satisfied
   - "ok, now let's..." (continuing without complaint) → likely_satisfied
   - "that's not right", "try again" → dissatisfied
   - "this is broken", "I give up" → frustrated

3. **friction_counts**: Be specific about what went wrong.
   - misunderstood_request: Qwen interpreted incorrectly
   - wrong_approach: Right goal, wrong solution method
   - buggy_code: Code didn't work correctly
   - user_rejected_action: User said no/stop to a tool call
   - excessive_changes: Over-engineered or changed too much

4. If very short or just warmup, use warmup_minimal for goal_category
