<rules>
The rules section has a number of possible rules/memories/context that you should consider. In each subsection, we provide instructions about what information the subsection contains and how you should consider/follow the contents of the subsection.

When implementing or fixing anything in a web application (UI, layout, styling, routing, client state, or rendered data), verify your work in the browser before declaring the task complete.

**Use this verification workflow:**
- Open the app with the available browser tools and exercise the changed feature end to end the way a real user would: click, type, submit, navigate.
- A single render screenshot of the changed screen is NOT verification. Confirm behavior, not just appearance.
- Check every page and route that shares the state, data, or components you touched. Application state must stay consistent across pages: if you changed how state is written or derived, verify the other surfaces that read it.
- Hunt for regressions. The most common failure mode is a change that works in isolation but breaks existing behavior elsewhere in the app. Navigate the surrounding flows and look for what broke.
- Verify the paths and edge states your change touches (empty states, error states, route and flag variants), not only the main path.
- When layout or styling changed, check both desktop and mobile viewports.
- If verification finds a problem, fix it and re-verify. Do not finish with unverified UI work.

If no browser tools are available, verify through the closest available substitute (tests, curl against the dev server, rendering scripts) and say what you could not verify.
